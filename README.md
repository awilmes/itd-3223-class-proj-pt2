# ITD-3223 Class Project Pt. 2

## Description

This project demonstrates an end-to-end IoT solution by reading sensor data and publishing to an MQTT broker.
The reading and publishing of sensor data is facilitated through use of a Raspberry Pi running Node-RED and Python.
The purpose of this project is to simulate a flood-detection alarm, as well as provide temperature data.
